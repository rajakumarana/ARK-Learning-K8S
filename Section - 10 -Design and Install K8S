Step 1: Intro for Design a kubernetes cluster
  Purpose: Learning/Development&Testing/Hosting Production Applications
  Cloud or Onprem: Kubeadm for on-prem,GKE for GCP,Kops for AWS,AKS for Azure
  Workloads: --> How many nodes? wat kind of Web/Big data/Analytics?Application Resource Requirements(CPU Intensive, Memory Intensive)
  Traffic: Heavy Traffic, Burst Traffic

Step 2: Chossing the Kubernetes Infra

Minikube              Vs KUBEADM
Deploys VMs              Requires VMs to be ready
Single node cluster      Single/Multi Node cluster

Our design: 1 Master node & 2 Woker node

Step 3: HA Kubernetes Cluster
